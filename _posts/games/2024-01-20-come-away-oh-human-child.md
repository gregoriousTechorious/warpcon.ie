It’s a fine morning in the village, except something is missing… no babies cry, no children laugh, no games are being played… no chores are being done! Where are all the kids? Is it some new trend you’re not hip to? Did some piper lure them away ‘cos you didn’t pay them for solving the rat problem? Did the Witch in the Woods lure them into her Gingerbread House? Good thing the village is unusually well stocked with Brave Adventurers who relish this sort of challenge.
