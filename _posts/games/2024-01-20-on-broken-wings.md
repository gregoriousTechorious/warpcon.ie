Red Giant is a rules lite, dark fantasy TTRPG inspired by the likes of 80s anime such as Berserk, Claymore, and Vampire Hunter D.
Explore the blasted lands of the Red Wastes, form pacts of power with Eldritch creatures, and scrape out your small existence among the few pockets of humanity still remaining.
But remember always....
God is Dead.
The End is Here.
You Cannot Save This World.
Beware the Red Giant.
