Fuse City. A neon-drenched metropolis built atop the corpse of a god. Ruled by the omnicorporation GEIST, it’s not only famous for its hyper-malls. The Coda, a grand tear in reality, sits at its foot, vomiting forth demons and otherworldly horrors into the city. Worry not though, GEIST Heroes™ are here to save the day\! Only problem is, you just watched them all die. It’s up to you, the left-over flunkies, interns, and janitors, to take up their abandoned legendary weapons and save the city, before a giant demon pulls all of Fuse City into the Coda.
