It's the kind of job that could make a chooms career. Find the missing kid of some mid level corpo who couldn't afford the optics of parental negligence, but could afford your ass instead. Discretion given, ED's earned. Simple.  
Only, nothing is ever simple in Night City.  
The kids gone amidst a string of other methheads and boosters across the neon metropolis, and with the number of random, violent killings increasing day by day, you've gotta see if there's still anything of the kid left to recover.  
So, you up for the job, Edgerunner?
