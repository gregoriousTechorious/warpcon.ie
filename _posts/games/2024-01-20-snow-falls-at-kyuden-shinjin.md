Winter has arrived in Rokugan, a time of rest when samurai sets aside blade and peasant puts down their burden. Not everyone can rest, however. You have all ended up in a remote pass of the Seikitsu Mountains, at the castle Kyuden Shijin, on the trail of a great evil. You have been welcomed, as hospitality demands, but you cannot feel at ease in this place. You know that the evil lurks here, and that it will threaten the whole Empire if it is not destroyed.
