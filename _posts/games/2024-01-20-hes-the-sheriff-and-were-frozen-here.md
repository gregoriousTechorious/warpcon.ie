Magic doesn't work right in the Mana Wastes. Sometimes, when it works wrong, it makes something people want. You've taken on a contract to check out a mine where they're digging one such something up; your bosses think they're up to something, and the mining operation isn't giving the full story. Unfortunately, the lawman who was looking after it has tricked you, and now you're stuck in a cave and the temperature's dropping fast. If you don't get out soon, then hypothermia will get you before you get revenge.
