You've been invited to dinner at Underfoot Hall, the home of the scandal-plagued Underfoot family\! They’ve got it all: money, titles, bitter family infighting, skeletons in the closet, upper lips stiffer than rigor mortis. It's very rare that Old Golfilmbul admits visitors, let alone hosts a dinner party \- what's going on?  
A game for up to six nosy and mildly inebriated Halfling Amateur Detectives.
