Deep Space Research Base Ixion (DSRB-I) is one of humanity's many research bases that float alone in the void of space. It shines like a beacon against the dark, and houses a crew dedicated to studying the effects of full-time living in Deep Space conditions. It is not pleasant. Each day is a struggle, but it is a struggle for the betterment of mankind. The station has six airlocks. They are necessary for refueling and resupply, for space walks, for repairs. So when your radios start picking up strange signals, and a seventh airlock is found in the cargo bay, what can you do except open it? Maybe behind the door you will find what has been knocking on the view-ports, or what has been making grass grow in the engines. Maybe you will find nothing. Hopefully, you find nothing at all.  
A game of Deep Space Horror, twisting dimensions, and eldritch science.
