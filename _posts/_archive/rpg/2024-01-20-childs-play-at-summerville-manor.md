But now she's begging for your help and offered 50 bucks, a BBQ and a year's supply of chocolate milk.

Your very real monstrous friends said 'No!'

Then she revealed she wants a mansion cleared of zombies.

Your very real eldritch monster friends said 'HECK YEAH!"

A 3-5 player dark-comedy adventure in the world of Monsters and Other Childish things.
