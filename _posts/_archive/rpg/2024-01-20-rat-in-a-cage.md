A Savage Worlds Scenario for up to 6 Intelligent Rats 
The Crucible may have been fake, an experiment of a madman, hidden in non-existent space. But it was home, to you and thousands of others, led by beautiful leaders and dedicated to finding Truth. But now it's all falling apart, rats turn to cannibalism and wage war over heresies. There is no future here, but if the world outside is just a larger Crucible, would you really be free there?
