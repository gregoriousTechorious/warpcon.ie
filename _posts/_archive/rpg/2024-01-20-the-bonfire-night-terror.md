It's the final night at Camp Riverbend, the legendary once a summer bonfire sleepaway! However, some of the older kids at camp are trying something daring this year. They're head to the old abandoned camp grounds to try and see the ghost of the first scout master who supposedly drowned on the very first bonfire night, over 50 years ago.
So clutch your sleeping bags and flashlights tight, because this camp sleepout is about to become much more sleepless.
