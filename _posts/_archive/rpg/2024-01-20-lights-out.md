Big sister Lex is away on a camping trip. She always brings back cool things when she goes on camping trips. Like last time she brought home a giant tooth on a string! And the time before that a pretty purple feather! We're not allowed go into her room, but sometimes the twins do go in and play with her camping toys. She doesn't seem to mind too much, and she's not home very often anyway. Mom and Dad have had to take little Gus to the hospital, so it's just me and my best friend looking after us for the night.

The twins were being very well behaved until dinner, then all the lights went out. So now we're all trying to find out what's going on. All the other houses are fine, and Mom's wards have activated, so nothing can come into the garden, or leave. We just have to wait for Mom and Dad or Lex to get back. Or the twins will do something stupidâ€¦
