Once upon a time- No! it starts, There was and there was not…- NO! it goes Beyond seven mountains, beyond seven forests…

But there are many ways a story can begin, as many ways for it to end, and oh so many ways for it to go in between. How will your story go? Will you escape in the nick of time, shoot someone with Chekov's crossbow or perhaps even try a million to one chance... that just might work. I've spent 15 years telling you all my stories... it's time for you to tell me one.
