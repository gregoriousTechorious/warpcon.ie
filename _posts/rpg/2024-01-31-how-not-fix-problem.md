"A damn is about to burst and flood the city\! This is a disaster\!"  
"NO\! This is an opportunity to prove to all MY GENIUS\! My latest invention will surely solve this problem\!"  
"But...but professor, how would flesh-eating, radioactive Bees possibly help?"  
"With the power of SCIENCE of course\!"  
Play mad scientists and their handlers trying to fix very normal problems with the worst tools imaginable. Inspired by: Genius the Transgression, Re-animator and other sci fi nonsense.
