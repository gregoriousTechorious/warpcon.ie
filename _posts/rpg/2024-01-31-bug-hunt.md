The crew of Backwater Station (BK-137) had one job; don't open the salvaged cargo. All they had to do was wait for the retrieval crew to arrive, but no, even that was too much to ask. Now the Lieutenant says they’ve lost contact with BK-137, and your unit has a big mess to clean up. You’re gonna have to seek out and cage some wild animal that these backwater yokels didn’t quarantine properly. Acting as a glorified dog catcher instead of deploying to a stand-up fight sounds like a waste of your skills, talent, and time. Still, you’re a marine and you’ve got a job to do. On the ready line\!
