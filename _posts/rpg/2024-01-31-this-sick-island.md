Miles off the coast of Derelictus, floating gently between the Spire above and the Heart below, lies the island of Anchorite. A small but proud merchant island, secluded from the troubles that run rampant everywhere else. Yet, for the first time in centuries, shipments have halted. The one thing an island nation fears is disease, and Anchorite's worst nightmare has arrived at its front door. The local physiker barely managed to send out a dire request for help before he too fell to The Rot. Word has it that the Heart's done this to Anchorite. Can you figure out why? Or will The Rot claim you too?
