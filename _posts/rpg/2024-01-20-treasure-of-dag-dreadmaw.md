An original D&D Adventure for LV3 characters 

Our heroes set sail for the jungle island of Mast Grave in search of the treasure of the notorious Dragonborn buccaneer Dag Dreadmaw, who used the island as his secret stash, but disappeared decades ago after being mutinied by his crew. According to rumours there are still riches to be had, as the paranoid pirate never revealed the location of his treasure to any of his men. Winning a tattered map in a crooked game of cards from an old sailor who claimed to have sailed on Dreadmaw’s ship The Ray’s Sting, the party set sail for an island surrounded by the striking site of many sunken vessels.
