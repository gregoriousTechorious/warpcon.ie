In a normal house in Iowa is a staircase that descends forever. A tourist attraction, it is run by the National Parks Service. It has now come to the attention of Delta Green, a clandestine organisation committed to fighting the unnatural. As a Delta Green agent, you must decide what threat it poses and how best to stop it.
