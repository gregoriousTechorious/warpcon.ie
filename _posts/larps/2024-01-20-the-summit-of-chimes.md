It is Christmas 1913, or for the citizens of the Fifth City, Christmas 1899 yet again. Tensions on both the Surface and the Neath have been escalating, and many of the factions of London have banded together to preserve their influence. Now, the 6 most powerful groups, and an assortment of outsiders, have been invited to a summit at the House of Chimes, in order to decide an important matter to the future of the sunless realm you call home. You are given only a few hours to stake your claim on the future. Be sure you spend it wisely, for in the shadows of the Bazaar, everything and everyone has a price.
