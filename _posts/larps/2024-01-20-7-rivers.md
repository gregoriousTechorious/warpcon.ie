The Great Khan has spent the last half-century building the Thyr into a prominent and powerful nation within the Lynaran Alliance. In all that time, she has remained unchallenged for her leadership among the khans of the various clans of the Thyr; an achievement very few past Khagan can claim.

However, there are those among her nation that believe she has polluted the old ways, and those who feel she has not done enough to modernise their peoples. In either case, she herself believes that it is almost time to pass the torch, and will soon choose a successor from among her children.

She has invited many people of note from all over Lynara and beyond to attend a feast as part of a cultural festival to celebrate an unprecedented time of peace and prosperity for the Thyr. Visitors are invited to come to Thyr'Laa, the first permanent city of the Thyr, and drink deep from their hospitality. Rumours are even circulating that she will be announcing her successor on the final night of the festivities. Whatever happens, it's bound to make for an unforgettable party\!
