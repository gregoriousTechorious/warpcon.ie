The Landsraad has been called into session to determine, by vote, who among the noble player characters shall assume control of Arrakis. The previous Steward, Archibald Richese, has been banished from the Known Universe for failing to meet production quotas for the spice melange, which is the key to interstellar travel and prolonged life. 'Dune Landsraad: Stewardship of Arrakis' is about feudalistic sci-fi rulers from different worlds seeking to increase their wealth and power through negotiation and intrigue.
