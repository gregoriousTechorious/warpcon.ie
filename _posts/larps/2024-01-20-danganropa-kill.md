“Welcome, students, to the all-new, heart-pounding, despair-inducing Killing Game\!”*

Things had finally been looking up. The world was recovering from the apocalypse, the horrors of the Killing Games only a memory, and you were a student at the new Hopes Peak Academy. Chosen for your unique talent in a world ravaged with despair, the future was filled with hope.

Unfortunately, today you awoke locked in a room, surrounded by your classmates and a robotic teddy bear. The Killing Game has started again, with a new horrifying twist. Only 2 people max will leave this room alive \- and if there’s more then 2 living in 3 hours time, than no-one survives. 

In this tense murder-mystery LARP with Blood-on-the-Clocktower inspired mechanics, it’s up to you to discover the truth. Who is the mastermind behind this, and why do they want you dead? Who will live? Who will kill?

Only time will tell. 3 hours, to be precise.

*— Players who’s characters die in this LARP may immediately join the accompanying LARP taking place simultaneously in the room next door. No familiarity with DanganRonpa necessary. —
