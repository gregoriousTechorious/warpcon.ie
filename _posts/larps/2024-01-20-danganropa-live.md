HOPE’S PEAK KIDNAPPING \- 3 WEEKS MISSING.

The news headline said everything. As an officer of the Future Foundation, it was a horrifying and embarrassing stain on the reputation of the organisation, especially when things were just starting to improve.  
Still, there’s not much you can do out here, in your small police station in rural Japan. That is, until 5 minutes ago, when the TV suddenly sprung to life by itself.

*“Testing, testing… one \- two\! Is anyone listening???”*

That voice. That face. Staring at you from the TV was the mascot of the killing game himself \- Monokuma, a robotic teddy bear with a horrifying grin.

*“We’re going to play a game Mr. Police Officer. You see, I’ve got your Ultimate Students nearby \- and right now, I’m juuuuuust about to make them kill each other. But, if you hurry, you might be able to get some more of them out alive. What do you say? You up for a challenge?”*

In this tense race against the clock, with escape-room style puzzles and tough choices, can you stop the Killing Game before its horrifying conclusion? Every minute more officers arrive to help \- and more students will die. Their fate is in your hands.

*— This LARP will start with a small player count, which will increase as PCs die in the accompanying LARP next door and their players join this game. No familiarity with DanganRonpa necessary. —*
